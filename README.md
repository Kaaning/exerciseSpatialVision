# exerciseSpatialVision

Here are the files for the exercise made by William VITALI for Spatial Vision.

The app can be accessed here : https://wvitali.github.io/exerciseSpatialVision/

As it was intended to be a web app, Cordova plugins were not used.

The src folder contains all the source files.
